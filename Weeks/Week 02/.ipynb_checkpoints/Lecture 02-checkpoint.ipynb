    "\n",
    "### Feature Scaling\n",
    "A tip for gradient descent is to ensure each of the parameters are of similar scale. This causes the gradient descent to converge more quickly since the step size taken in the simultaneous update is roughly the same for each parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, back to our house cost example, se we have \n",
    "* $x_1$ : size (0-2000 sq ft)\n",
    "* $x_2$ : number of bedrooms (1-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our two parameters here are of very different scales, so a tip is to scale the features so that they range from approximately -1 to 1. In this example, we can rescale as such:\n",
    "* $x_1$ : $\\frac{\\text{size}}{2000}$\n",
    "* $x_2$ : $\\frac{\\text{number of bedrooms}}{5}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps ensure that a step in the gradient descent is of similar size for the various parameters. This allows the algorithm to converge more quickly. It's mainly just important that the parameters are all scaled to the same order of magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another idea is to normalize by the mean. To do so, remap as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_i := \\frac{x_i - \\mu_i}{\\sigma_i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "* $\\mu_i$ is the mean value of the features\n",
    "* $\\sigma_i$ is the range or standard deviation of the features\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, if our mean house size is 1000 sq ft. and our mean bedroom number is 2,\n",
    "* $x_1$ : $\\frac{\\text{size} - 1000}{2000}$\n",
    "* $x_2$ : $\\frac{\\text{number of bedrooms} - 2}{5}$\n",
    "This scales the range of parameters back to around -0.5 and 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't have to be exact. We just need to parameters in the same order of magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging & The Learning Rate\n",
    "It's useful to plot the calculated minimized cost function per iteration of the gradient descent to ensure that the cost is gradually descending after each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the number of steps it may take to converge with gradient descent will vary greatly per problem and execution. So plotting the minimized cost function is a good way to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful rule for is to declare convergence\n",
    "when the cost function decreases by less than .001 in one iteration. It can sometimes be difficult though, depending on the problem. So agian, looking at the plot and finding when the curve is flattening is a good tip.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the curve is not decreasing but increasing or oscillating instead, it's a good indicator that your learning rate is too large.  If the learning rate is too small, the algorithm will converge very slowly. It's suggested to actually try a *range* of values to capture one that's too slow and one that's too large and find the best convergence values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features and Polynomial Regression\n",
    "Back to the housing example, suppose we have a hypothesis where we are considering only the \"frontage\" or the width of the plot of land on which the house sits, and the \"depth\", the length of the plot of land on which the house sits. We can actually for a new model then that uses the land area of the plot of land. So we've now reduced the number of features from two to one. However, perhaps now a multi-degree polynomial is a better fit that a simple line. Let's say we've chosen a cubic function as our hypothesis. Our hypothesis function now looks as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "h_\\theta (x) & = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + \\theta_2 x_2 + \\theta_3 x_3 \\\\\n",

    "* $x_1 = (\\text{size})$\n",
    "* $x_2 = (\\text{size})^2$\n",
    "* $x_3 = (\\text{size})^3$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: since we've chosen our features and model like this, feature scaling is much more important now. This is because the exponents in the polynomial will greatly separate features of different scales and this could slow down the gradient descent much moreso than in the linear case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a lot of freedom in choosing our features. We could have set it to a quadratic polynomial:\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But we have to think about what this implies. A quadratic is symmetric, so it may fit the training data available reliably well, but it may not be a great fit. We'd expect the price to increase with the size of the plot of land, and the minimization of the cost function would ensure that the quadratic regression closely fits the available training data by increasing with size, but since it's quadratic, some other part of the regression will be unrealistic. \n",
    "\n",
    "A better choice might be\n",
    "\n",

    "## Computing Parameters Analytically - The Normal Equation\n",
    "The normal equation, for some linear regression problems, will give us a much better way to solve for the optimal value of the parameters in our hypothesis. So far the algorithm that we've been using for linear regression is gradient descent where in order to minimize the cost function we would take this iterative algorithm that takes many steps, multiple iterations of gradient descent to converge to the global minimum. In contrast, the normal equation would give us a method to solve for theta analytically, so that rather than needing to run this iterative algorithm, we can instead just solve for the optimal value for the paramets all at once, so that in basically one step you get to the optimal value.\n",
