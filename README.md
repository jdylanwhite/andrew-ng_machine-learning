# Machine Learning with Andrew Ng

This repository contained my Python implementation of [Prof. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/). The course was developed for MATLAB/Octave, so I'm going through the course and converting everything to Python using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Topics Covered

The course is broken into 11 weeks as follows, with the checkmark denoting completion of the course:

- [X] Week 1
  - Introduction to Machine Learning
  - Linear Regressions with One Variable
  - Linear Algebra Review
- [X] Week 2
  - Linear Regressions with Multiple Variables
  - Octave/Matlab Tutorial (not covered in my notes)
- [X] Week 3
  - Logistic Regression
  - Regularization
- [X] Week 4
  - Neural Networks - Representation
- [ ] Week 5
  - Neural Networks - Learning
- [ ] Week 6
  - Advice for Applying Machine Learning
  - Machine Learning System Design
- [ ] Week 7
  - Support Vector Machines
- [ ] Week 8
  - Unsupervised Learning
  - Dimensionality Reduction
- [ ] Week 9
  - Anomaly Detection
  - Recommender Systems
- [ ] Week 10
  - Large Scale Machine Learning
- [ ] Week 11
  - Application Example: Photo OCR
